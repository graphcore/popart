  Popart Targets Created Here
  ---------------------------

  We build three targets, which expose the dependencies to varying degrees of
  visibility.

  popart
    This is the main target most users should link against.
  
  popart-only
    Keeps onnx, protobuf, and the poplar libraries private. In general, these
    may be required by the user to actually interact usefully with the C++ API;
    but for some users (in particular poptorch) it is unnecessary and pollutes
    their package.
  
  popart-internal
    Has everything internally used as public. This is for internal targets
    only, like tests, so does not get installed (no config file).
  
  Look at the variables defined below for the exact definitions of what is
  public and private at each visibility level.
  
  Implementation Notes for Maintainers:
  -------------------------------------

    You can think of the visibility levels as:
      
        popart-only < popart < popart-internal
    
    Target B will have A in its link interface, if A < B as described above.

    The lowest visibility target will be the only actual library. It will
    include and link everything as required to be built, keeping things at the
    desired (lowest) level of visibility. The other targets will all be
    INTERFACE targets that incrementally add more dependencies to the interface
    properties.

    The variables POPART_PRIVATE_DEPS_* are private to popart (all targets). If
    a dependency is private even at the lowest visibility level, it should be
    added once here.

    The variables <target>_DEPS_* are public to that target and above. If a
    dependency is public to the visibility level of <target> and above, it
    should be added once here.

    These variables, when passed to `target_include_directories` and
    `target_link_libraries`, will be wrapped in `$<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>` genexes
    because we do not ship them in the installed package - we expect the user
    to provide the dependencies themselves when linking popart.
