/**
 * An abstract base class through which input and output data is passed to a
 * Session (see Session::run).
 *
 * An IStepIO implementation should conceptually implement a rolling list of
 * active buffers for each input and output tensor. Every successful call to
 * IStepIO::in should yield a new data buffer for PopART and add it to the head
 * of the conceptual list. Conversely, every call to IStepIO::inComplete should
 * be taken to mean that the buffer at the tail-end of the list is no longer
 * being used by PopART. This buffer is removed from the conceptual list.
 *
 * Note that a IStepIO::in call with the *prefetch* flag set is only
 * considered successful when it returns data.
 *
 * Output works analogously to input.
 *
 * The expected total number of input (resp. output) buffers that are
 * 'completed' for a tensor in one Session::run call is `bps` \f$\times\f$
 * SessionOptions::accumulationFactor \f$\times\f$
 * SessionOptions::globalReplicationFactor, where `bps` is the number of
 * batches per call to Session::run (this is a value captured by the DataFlow
 * instance passed to Session).
 *
 * Note, however, that there may be additional 'uncompleted' calls to
 * IStepIO::in (resp. IStepIO::out).
 *
 * Further more, the number of number of input (resp. output) buffers that may
 * be 'incomplete' *at a given time for a given tensor* should not normally be
 * higher than SessionOptions::bufferingDepth \f$\times\f$
 * SessionOptions::globalReplicationFactor, but this bound is not guaranteed.
 *
 * **EXAMPLE**: Suppose a session is configured such that the total expected
 * number of input buffers is 6 and these are input buffers for a tensor with
 * ID `"t"` with 100 elements. The associated input calls in IStepIO may look
 * like this if SessionOptions::bufferingDepth is 3:
 *
 * ```
 * in("t", 100, false) -> Give buffer[0] to PopART.
 * in("t", 100, true) -> Give buffer[1] to PopART.
 * in("t", 100, true) -> Give buffer[2] to PopART.
 * inComplete("t", 100) -> buffer[0] is no longer required and can be reused.
 * in("t", 100, true) -> Give buffer[3] to PopART.
 * inComplete("t", 100) -> buffer[1] is no longer required and can be reused.
 * in("t", 100, true) -> Give buffer[4] to PopART.
 * inComplete("t", 100) -> buffer[2] is no longer required and can be reused.
 * in("t", 100, true) -> Give buffer[5] to PopART.
 * inComplete("t", 100) -> buffer[3] is no longer required and can be reused.
 * in("t", 100, true) -> No data available, return nullptr.
 * inComplete("t", 100) -> buffer[4] is no longer required and can be reused.
 * inComplete("t", 100) -> buffer[5] is no longer required and can be reused.
 * ```
