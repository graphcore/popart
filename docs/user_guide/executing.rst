.. _popart_executing:

Executing graphs
----------------

The ``Session`` class is used to run graphs on an IPU device.
Before the graph can be run, the way in which data will be transferred
to and from the IPU must be specified. Then an IPU device can be selected
to execute the graph.

Setting input/output data buffers for an execution
==================================================

The ``PyStepIO`` class defines the input data for a specific execution.  It
takes a dictionary with the input tensor names as keys, and Python
arrays for the data values.  It also takes a similar dictionary of names and
buffers for the output values.

A convenience method ``initAnchorArrays`` can create the output buffers
and dictionary for you, given the anchors (output nodes) which were
specified in the ``DataFlow`` object during session construction.

.. code-block:: python

  # Create buffers to receive results from the execution
  anchors = session.initAnchorArrays()

  # Generate some random input data
  data_a = np.random.rand(1).astype(np.float32)
  data_b = np.random.rand(1).astype(np.float32)

  stepio = popart.PyStepIO({'a': data_a, 'b': data_b}, anchors)


.. TODO: Add something about the pytorch data feeder.


If there are any pre-defined inputs (such as weights or biases) in the graph
then they will not be specified in the ``PyStepIO`` object.  However, before
executing the graph, they will need to the copied to the hardware.
If there are any optimiser-specific parameters which can be modified,
then these must be written to the device. For example:

.. code-block:: python

  session.weightsFromHost()


These can also be updated between executions.

.. code-block:: python

  # Update learning rate parameter between training steps
  stepLr = learningRate[step]
  session.updateOptimizerFromHost(popart.SGD(stepLr))


Retrieving results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DataFlow`` class describes how to execute the graph.  The second parameter is
a description of the anchors, the results to fetch from the graph.

.. code-block:: python

  df = popart.DataFlow(1, {o: popart.AnchorReturnType("ALL")})

This is a Python dictionary with keys that are the names of the tensors to retrieve
from the model. The associated values are an ``AnchorReturnType``, which is one of:

* ``popart.AnchorReturnType("ALL")``: a vector of results is returned, one for each
  iteration of the graph.
* ``popart.AnchorReturnType("EVERYN", N)``: a vector containing the tensor, but
  only for iterations which are divisible by ``N``.
* ``popart.AnchorReturnType("FINAL")``: the value of the tensor on the final
  iteration through the graph.
* ``popart.AnchorReturnType("SUM")``: the sum of the values of the tensor
  from each iteration through the graph.

Selecting a device for execution
================================

The device manager allows the selection of an IPU configuration for executing the session.
The device must be passed into the session constructor.

.. code-block:: python

  df = popart.DataFlow(1, {o: popart.AnchorReturnType("ALL")})
  device = popart.DeviceManager().createCpuDevice()
  s = popart.InferenceSession("onnx.pb", deviceInfo=device, dataFlow=df)

The device manager can enumerate the available devices with the ``enumerateDevices``
method. The  ``acquireAvailableDevice`` method will acquire the
next available device. The first parameter specifies how many IPUs to acquire.

.. code-block:: python

  # Acquire a two-IPU pair
  dev = popart.DeviceManager().acquireAvailableDevice(2)

Using ``acquireDeviceById`` will select a device from the list
of IPU configurations, as given by the ``enumerateDevices`` method, or by the ``gc-info``
command-line tool. This may be a single IPU or a group of IPUs.

.. code-block:: python

  # Acquire IPU configuration 5
  dev = popart.DeviceManager().acquireDeviceById(5)

The method ``createIpuModelDevice`` is used to create a Poplar software emulation
of an IPU device.  Similarly, the method ``createCpuDevice`` creates a simple Poplar CPU backend.
See the `PopART C++ API Reference
<https://www.graphcore.ai/docs/popart-c-api-reference>`_ for details.

By default the functions ``acquireAvailableDevice`` and ``acquireDeviceById``
will attach the device immediately to the running process. You can pass the
``DeviceConnectionType.OnDemand`` option to the ``DeviceManager`` to defer the
device attachment until it is required by PopART.

.. code-block:: python

  # Acquire four IPUs on demand
  connectionType=DeviceConnectionType.OnDemand
  dev = popart.DeviceManager().acquireAvailableDevice(4, connectionType=connectionType)

Executing a session
===================

Once the device has been selected, the graph can be compiled for it, and
loaded into the hardware.  The ``prepareDevice`` method is used for this:

.. code-block:: python

  session.prepareDevice()

To execute the session you need to call the session's ``run`` method.

.. code-block:: python

  session.run(stepio)


If the session is created for inference, the user is responsible for ensuring
that the forward graph finishes with the appropriate operation for an inference.
If losses are provided to the inference session the forward pass and the losses
will be executed, and the final loss value will be returned.


If the session was created for training, any pre-initialised parameters will be
updated to reflect the changes made to them by the optimiser.

Saving and loading a model
==========================

The method ``modelToHost`` writes a model with updated weights
to the specified file.

.. code-block:: python

  session.modelToHost("trained_model.onnx")

A file of saved parameters, for example from an earlier execution session, can
be loaded into the current session.

.. code-block:: python

  session.resetHostWeights("test.onnx")
  session.weightsFromHost()


.. _popart_profiling:

Retrieving profiling reports
============================

Poplar can provide profiling information on the compilation and execution of
the graph. Profiling is not enabled by default.

To get profiling reports in PopART, you will need to enable profiling in the
Poplar engine. For example:

.. code-block:: python

  opts = popart.SessionOptions()
  opts.engineOptions = {"debug.instrument": "true"}

You can also control what information is included in the profiling report:

.. code-block:: python

  opts.reportOptions = {"showExecutionSteps": "true"}

There are three method functions of the session object to access the profiling
information:

* ``getSummaryReport`` retrieves a text summary of the compilation and execution of
  the graph.
* ``getGraphReport`` returns a JSON format report on the compilation of
  the graph
* ``getExecutionReport`` returns a JSON format report on all executions
  of the graph since the last report was fetched.

If profiling is not enabled, then the summary report will say 'Execution profiling not enabled'
and the execution report will contain '{"profilerMode":"NONE"}'.

Both ``getGraphReport`` and ``getExecutionReport`` can optionally return
a Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) formatted report.

For more information on profiling control and the information returned by these functions, see the
Profiling chapter of the
`Poplar and PopLibs User Guide
<https://www.graphcore.ai/docs/poplar-and-poplibs-user-guide>`_.

.. _popart_logging:

Turning on execution tracing
============================

PopART contains an internal logging system that can show the progress of graph
compilation and execution.

Logging information is generated from the following modules:

=========   =================================
popart      Generic PopART module, if no module specified
session     The ONNX session (the PopART API)
ir          The intermediate representation
devicex     The Poplar backend
transform   The transform module
pattern     The pattern module
builder     The builder module
op          The op module
opx         The opx module
ces         The constant expression module
python      The Python module
none        An unidentified module
=========   =================================


The logging levels, in decreasing verbosity, are shown below.

========  ============================
TRACE     The highest level, shows the
          order of method calls
DEBUG
INFO
WARN      Warnings
ERR       Errors
CRITICAL  Only critical errors
OFF       No logging
========  ============================

The default is "OFF". You can change this, and where the logging information is written to,
by setting environment variables, see :any:`popart_env_vars`.

Programming interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also control the logging level for each module in your program.

For example, in Python:

.. code-block:: python

  # Set all modules to DEBUG level
  popart.getLogger().setLevel("DEBUG")
  # Turn off logging for the session module
  popart.getLogger("session").setLevel("OFF")

And in C++:

.. code-block:: C++

  // Set all modules to DEBUG level
  popart::logger::setLevel("popart", "DEBUG")
  // Turn off logging for the session module
  popart::logger::setLevel("session", "OFF")


Output format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The information is output in the following format:

.. code-block:: none

  [<timestamp>] [<module>] [<level>] <logging string>

For example:

.. code-block:: none
