    """
    Update the values of multiple elements in an tensor.

    Elements are specified by `indices`. The elements are updated with the
    values in `values`.

    `scatter` requires the three input tensor to be of the same rank `r >=
    1`.  The optional attribute `axis` identifies the axis of the tensor along which the update will be performed. By default, the outer-most axis, that is axis 0, is used. The output of the operation
    is produced by creating a copy of the input data, and then updating its
    value to values specified by updates at specific index positions specified
    by `indices`. Its output shape is the same as the shape of data.

    For each entry in `values`, the target index in `t`` is obtained by combining
    the corresponding entry in `indices` with the index of the entry itself: the
    index-value for dimension = axis is obtained from the value of the
    corresponding entry in indices and the index-value for dimension != axis is
    obtained from the index of the entry itself.

    Pseudo example:

    .. code-block:: python

        x1 = x.copy()
        scatter(x1, [1, 2, 3], [-1, -2, -3])
        x2 = x.copy()
        x[1] = -1
        x[2] = -2
        x[3] = -3
        x1 == x2

    Args:
        t: Tensor
            Input tensor
        indices: Tensor
            The indices of the elements to update
        values: Tensor
            The values to update the tensor with
        axis: int
            Which axis to set on. Default is 0.
        available_memory_proportion: Optional[float]
            The maximum proportion of available memory on each tile that this layer
            should consume temporarily during the course of the operation.
            Defaults to 1.0 if not set globally.

    Returns:
        scatter: Tensor
            The tensor with updated values.
